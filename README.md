## ASSUMPTIONS

* Currently, the code base is prepared according to individual's system. Thus, it asks for password initially. Although, this can be modified in the later stage by keeping a common DB with a common password making it static, irrespective of the system 
* Two courses can not have the same name.

## BUGS
* Read button does not work when there are no courses in the table  
* Only the Create button works after refreshing the window. To use the other buttons, the Create button needs to be used at least once.
* Need to make index.html and courses.html clear. ie which is what
* Ensure Course, Module Names are unique. THis will cause BT Elsewhere. unique i mean even without case sensitivity
* What about ordering of the modules in a particular course etc.?
